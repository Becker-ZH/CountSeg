Instruction for reproduce experiment:

This is the code for the first improvement in our project. We implemented a Gaussian kernel to smooth the pseudo ground truth. Source code is here: https://github.com/Becker-ZH/CountSeg. More can be found in the PPT and report.

We run this part on the Amazon EC2 with all the envrinoment installed, which only need envrionment setup once. If you would like the access to our Amazon EC2, please feel free to contact us. 

With a correct setup of environment requirements, please run 1.ipynb in a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. If run 1.ipynb in a separate file in the Google Colab, you need to first run environment setup code given in our main code by Google Colab and could also be found in the Github link above.
