**Reproduce Instructions**

In our reproduction, we have modified following files. The files with `colab` can be run directly on Google Colab. Running these files on local machine or Amazon EC2 needs to configure the Linux environment accordingly.

In order to test a file, copy it to the location following it and then run it.

```
1. `demo-local.py`          `CountSeg/demo`
2. `test-colab.ipynb`       `CountSeg/test`
3. `train-colab.ipynb`      `CountSeg/train`
4. `training-local.ipynb`   `CountSeg/test`
```
